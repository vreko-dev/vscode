# SnapBack Notifications System

This document describes the enhanced notification system implemented in SnapBack to provide users with more detailed, actionable, and confidence-building alerts.

## Overview

The enhanced notification system builds user trust by showing SnapBack's technical competence and specific risk detection reasoning. Each notification type provides:

1. **Specific Triggers**: Shows exactly what pattern triggered the alert
2. **Technical Competence**: Demonstrates understanding of AI tools, file types, risk factors
3. **Confidence Metrics**: Shows detection confidence percentages
4. **Actionable Information**: Clear next steps and recovery options
5. **SnapBack Branding**: Consistent tone and emoji usage
6. **Progressive Disclosure**: Clean collapsed view, detailed expanded view
7. **Risk Context**: Explains why something is risky, not just that it is risky

## Notification Types

### Risk Detection Alerts

**Collapsed:**

```
🛡️ SnapBack detected potential AI-induced risk
```

**Expanded:**

```
🛡️ SnapBack Risk Analysis - Medium Severity

Detected Patterns:
• Package.json modified (3 dependencies updated)
• TypeScript config changes in 2 files simultaneously
• Change velocity: 47 files/minute (typical AI assistant pattern)
• Dependency cascade risk: High (major version bumps detected)

Files at risk: package.json, tsconfig.json, src/types/*.ts
Last safe checkpoint: 2 minutes ago

```

## Implementation Details

### NotificationManager Extension

The NotificationManager class has been extended with new methods for each notification type:

1. `showEnhancedRiskDetected()`
2. `showEnhancedCheckpointCreated()`
3. `showEnhancedAiActivity()`
4. `showEnhancedSecurityAlert()`
5. `showEnhancedLargeChange()`
6. `showEnhancedFailureRecovery()`
7. `showEnhancedSystemStatus()`

Each method accepts detailed parameters and formats the notification with appropriate icons, messages, and actions.

## Configuration

### Notification Settings

Users can customize notification behavior through VS Code settings:

| Setting                                        | Default | Description                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `snapback.notifications.showCheckpointCreated` | `true`  | Show enhanced notifications after snapshot creation |
| `snapback.notifications.duration`              | `3000`  | Duration (ms) to display notifications              |
| `snapback.showAutoCheckpointNotifications`     | `true`  | Toast notifications for Watch-level auto snapshots  |

### Disabling Notifications

To disable specific notification types:

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`)
2. Search for "snapback"
3. Find the relevant notification setting
4. Toggle off to disable

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Review Notifications**: Take time to understand what each notification is telling you
2. **Use Actions**: Notifications provide actionable buttons - use them when appropriate
3. **Customize Settings**: Adjust notification frequency and types to your workflow
4. **Report Issues**: If notifications seem incorrect or confusing, report them

### For Developers

1. **Consistent Branding**: Use consistent emojis and terminology
2. **Actionable Content**: Always provide clear next steps
3. **Confidence Metrics**: Include confidence percentages when available
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Keep collapsed views clean, detailed views informative
